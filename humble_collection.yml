  # Script to handle humble:// scheme deep links
  #
  # The Humble App opens your web browser so you can login
  # and allow the app access to your account.
  #
  # When you do allow access, it opens a humble://login?code=<YOUR_AUTH_CODE> url.
  # The app expects a humble://login/code=<YOUR_AUTH_CODE> url, however (not sure how
  # this even works on Windows).
  #
  # So this script also replaces the first ? with a / before forwarding the url to the Humble App.
  #
  # Do note a couple of things:
  #
  # - When the installer runs, it sets the wine binary from your default wine runner in the script.
  #   This means that if you ever change your runner and need to login, you'll also need to change
  #   the runner path in this script. This shouldn't come up too often, however, as you only need
  #   this working for login. You should be safe to change whenever, as long as you're logged in.
  # - It assumes you have Esync and Fsync enabled. This is because if you run the app with these
  #   options, the script needs to sync with them as well, or wine will crash and it will not let
  #   you login. Change these to "0" if you don't use either or any of them.
